## Overview ##

This dataset contains GeoJSON feature layers for Colorado instream flow reaches and termini, and natural lake levels.
The files are generated from instream flow layers from
[Colorado's Decision Support Systems](https://cdss.colorado.gov/gis-data/gis-data-by-category)
for geographic areas that are typically used in analysis and visualizations.
